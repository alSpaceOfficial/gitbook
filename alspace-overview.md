# alSpace Overview

## **1.1 What we are working on**

We are trying to create a universe that is fun, full of possibilities, and without borders, called alSpace. On a macro stage, alSpace is made up of all kinds of creative games, all of which in their own unique way (as determined by the game developers) give birth to a token called alSpark". According to this token, players can use to create an incredible NFT called alBot, which is the core of the world and which we all need to use in alSpace. Each alBot carries a genome full of possibilities, and the recombination of these genomes will create a new alBot. More interestingly, the genome can be traded. Players can think of it as another NFT. Players can freely trade alBot and alBot's genome in the marketplace. Each transaction will bring benefits to the Players.

&#x20;

In the next three years, we will continue to bring players amazing games based on alBot in an orderly manner. We are proud to say that these games have different genres to fulfill other players' demands, and we will also utilize the features of alBot to let players enjoy the fun of playing to earn in the games.



## **1.2 How Players Can Benefit**

In the past, players' virtual property was easily infringed, their in-game transactions were difficult to be secure, and even players' accounts did not fully belong to them. This not only affects the value of the game but also ruins the player experience. However, with the development of blockchain technology, players are not only able to trade safely but also bring more realistic value to players through NFT. We are committed to creating a completely decentralized universe where all players' virtual property belongs to the players to serve better not only the gamers who love the game, but also the people who want to gain revenue through alSpace. It doesn't matter if players don't understand blockchain, NFT, tokens, or even games. This will be a great experiment and a good opportunity for participants to be able to understand these concepts, and we hope to provide a secure platform for all to participate in, for which we will work tirelessly and advance forward.

Benefit method:

* Training and strengthening the alBot in hand;
* Trading alBot with others in the marketplace;
* Trading specific equipment and props with others on the marketplace creates value in the universe that benefits all players and participants, such as getting more people to join, building great community experiences, making more exciting games, etc. All of these contributions will be made public, and the rewards will be entirely fair and transparent, and all people who help players build alSpace will receive an "alSpark ( alSpark)‚Äù;
* Completing specific tasks in the game.

## **1.3 The Future and Our Mission**

We are still experimenting, and we hope to make alBot even more valuable. In the future, alSpace will have thousands of meaningful and genuine games (planets) and a lot of applications that can bring more value to all users in real life. In other words, alBot will bring players fun in the games (planets) and help players in other areas. As of now, the concept of play to earn is still unclear, but we believe that with a good exploration method and a healthy mechanism environment for all people, all participants can enjoy entertainment first and bring more economic benefits to themselves at the same time. We will spare no effort to discover a reasonable exploration method and mechanism environment. At the same time, we will also bring more social scenes to make alSpace more open and bring more opportunities for more people. Such a social scene is not only for players who wish to have an unforgettable play experience but also for those who wish to get investment opportunities and those who want to gain more friends.



It's a universe of endless possibilities, and we sincerely hope you'll join in and enjoy the great future!
