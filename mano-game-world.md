In this world, players need to lead alBot bravely into uncharted territory, including land, sea, city, forest, or mountain, to challenge powerful rulers to liberate these areas. And these rulers seem to be harboring some huge conspiracy, and the rulers have enough power to destroy the whole world, so players need to match different types and professions of alBot according to different rulers' abilities to form a 6-person team to deal with the upcoming challenges. AlBot will create a team, and alBot will be given new occupations. These occupations allow alBot to have different team positioning in the team.
