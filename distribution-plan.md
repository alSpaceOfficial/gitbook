# Distribution Plan

The first game Mano in alSpace will be available to players in the next three months. The game is free for all players, but players will still need a minimum of three alBot to start a game.

In 6 months after that, we will release another game with entirely different gameplay than Mano, so stay tuned for more details and information on the game.

Players' alBot will also be more valuable because of the arrival of more games. We expect players to bring their alBot into alSpace to meet with one game after another and carry out a fantastic adventure. In addition, we plan to release more games with other game developers in 3 years to enrich the alSpace ecosystem.
